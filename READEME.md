This repository is for testing and developing easy to understand and implement servers, for personalised use. Python 3 is being used to develop all the server codes. The goal is to use the low-level socket module. This will be a free and open source application. The program itself is implemented using thread classes. Using thread gives us a easy way to modularise the server to our specific needs.
